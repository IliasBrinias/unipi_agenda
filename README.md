### Unipi Agenda web app
Your team will implement a web application that will serve as an online agenda. Your software will be an HTML5 application intended for smartphone use. A new user will be able to register in your system and an existing user will be able to login. Each logged in user will be able to view, edit, post, or delete an appointment / meeting in a calendar / agenda setting, at specific dates / times and, if they wish, to indicate duration. If the appointment / meeting includes other people (registered on the platform), you should implement the following:
1. The participating users should also be visible during the appointment.
2. For any information / modification of the appointment / meeting by one of the participants, the other interested parties should be informed. The appointment creator can modify the details of the appointment (time or duration), while the other participants can submit comments and / or whether they will attend or not. It is desirable to have a website (php, MySQL), as an alternative way to access from a computer. End users of the application: any interested users
